# hello-world
A test process to understand Github and track my progress as a web developer.

My web development journey started on a sunny day in 2018 when I decided to build website using WordPress platform. Although I had sketchy knowledge of HTML and a bit of CSS, I have since committed to learning other languages that woul be vital in becoming an expert web developer. I have a long list of things I need to learn to achieve my goal.

I recently started learning javaScript and Git version control was in my face and i decided to start using my GitHub account to track my progress.
